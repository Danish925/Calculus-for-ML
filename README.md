# 📘 Calculus for Machine Learning

This repository contains my **personal learning notes and Jupyter notebooks**
focused on the **calculus foundations required for Machine Learning**.

The goal is to build **strong intuition** for how ML models learn using:
- derivatives
- gradients
- gradient descent
- chain rule (backpropagation intuition)

All explanations are **intuition-first** and supported by **NumPy-based experiments**.
